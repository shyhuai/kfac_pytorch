# This is the default system-wide MCA parameters defaults file.
# Specifically, the MCA parameter "mca_param_files" defaults to a
# value of
# "$HOME/.openmpi/mca-params.conf:$sysconf/openmpi-mca-params.conf"
# (this file is the latter of the two).  So if the default value of
# mca_param_files is not changed, this file is used to set system-wide
# MCA parameters.  This file can therefore be used to set system-wide
# default MCA parameters for all users.  Of course, users can override
# these values if they want, but this file is an excellent location
# for setting system-specific MCA parameters for those users who don't
# know / care enough to investigate the proper values for them.

# Note that this file is only applicable where it is visible (in a
# filesystem sense).  Specifically, MPI processes each read this file
# during their startup to determine what default values for MCA
# parameters should be used.  mpirun does not bundle up the values in
# this file from the node where it was run and send them to all nodes;
# the default value decisions are effectively distributed.  Hence,
# these values are only applicable on nodes that "see" this file.  If
# $sysconf is a directory on a local disk, it is likely that changes
# to this file will need to be propagated to other nodes.  If $sysconf
# is a directory that is shared via a networked filesystem, changes to
# this file will be visible to all nodes that share this $sysconf.

# The format is straightforward: one per line, mca_param_name =
# rvalue.  Quoting is ignored (so if you use quotes or escape
# characters, they'll be included as part of the value).  For example:

# Disable run-time MPI parameter checking
#   mpi_param_check = 0

# Note that the value "~/" will be expanded to the current user's home
# directory.  For example:

# Change component loading path
#   component_path = /usr/local/lib/openmpi:~/my_openmpi_components

# See "ompi_info --param all all" for a full listing of Open MPI MCA
# parameters available and their default values.
